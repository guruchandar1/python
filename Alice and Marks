x, y = map(int, input().split())

if x >= 2 * y:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")




Sample 1:
Input
Output
2 1
Yes
Explanation:
Alice has scored 
𝑋
=
2
X=2 marks whereas Bob has scored 
𝑌
=
1
Y=1 mark. As Alice has scored twice as much as Bob (i.e. 
𝑋
≥
2
𝑌
X≥2Y), the answer is Yes.

Sample 2:
